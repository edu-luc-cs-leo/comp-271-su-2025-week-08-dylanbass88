Looking back at the work I’ve done in this class so far, I can honestly say I’ve come a long way since the beginning of the course. At first, when we were learning about linked
 lists and basic node structures, I didn’t fully get why we were doing things in a certain way. A lot of it felt confusing, and I was mostly just trying to make the code 
 compile without really thinking about how everything was connected. But after working on more projects and messing up a few times, I started to understand why planning ahead 
 actually helps. With this week’s assignment, I really had to think about how to approach the problem. It wasn’t something I could just wing or guess my way through.
  Writing the contains method helped me understand how hash tables actually use hashing to locate things, and I had to use loops more carefully than before. 
  The rehashing part was harder because it involved copying over the old data into a new bigger array, and I had to keep track of everything like usage and load factor.
   It was annoying at first, but once it clicked, it felt kind of satisfying to figure it out. Another thing I noticed is I’ve gotten better at spotting errors and testing 
   my code. The test file helped a lot because I could instantly see what was failing and fix it, which is way better than just guessing if it works. 
   I used to panic when something didn’t run the first time, but now I’ve learned to slow down and read what’s actually happening
